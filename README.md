# beets-rymgenre

`beets-rymgenre` is a [beets][beets] plugin to fetch genre information from
[rateyourmusic.com][rym] and assigning it to your albums and items.

## WARNING

I don't recommend using this plugin! I got banned from rateyourmusic.com in
mid-2016 for an abusive use of the site by using this plugin. The answer I got
from Hossein Sharifi pointed out to scraping being disallowed by
rateyourmusic.com:

> RYM does not allow (and has never allowed) access via scraping or other types
> of scripts which access the site in an automated fashion. Please refrain from
> doing so until we complete our API, which is currently being developed and
> should be part of Sonemic.

The API
is [currently being developed](https://rateyourmusic.com/rymzilla/view?id=683)
and I might get back to this project when it is published.

## Installation

The plugin requires [lxml][lxml] and [requests][requests], which you can install
using [pip][pip] by typing:

```
$ pip install lxml requests
```

After having [lxml][lxml] and [requests][requests] installed, edit your config
file and add the path to the `beetsplug` folder of a clone of this repository to
your [pluginpath][beets-pluginpath] line. Also enable the plugin by adding the
`rymgenre` value to your `plugins` line.

## Configuration

[rateyourmusic.com][rym] attributes genres per album. Each album has a set of
primary genres and a set of secondary genres. You can configure the plugin to
set only the primary genres of an album or both the primary and secondary
genres. There is also a [tree][rym-tree] of genres and you can set only the most
specific genres for an album or the union of ancestor genres for each genre. The
default configuration is setting all primary and secondary genres and their
ancestors. You can override both settings by using the `classes` and `depth`
configuration values. The `classes` configuration can be either `primary` or
`all`, while `depth` can be either `node` or `all`:

```
rymgenre:
    classes: all
    depth: all
```

It is also possible to configure the separator to use for multiple genres. The
default value is `', '`, but it is customizable through the `separator`
configuration value:

```
rymgenre:
    separator: ' / '
```

## Running

`beets-rymgenre` doesn't run automatically on import. Instead, one should use
the command `beet rymgenre [QUERY]` to fetch genres for albums matching a
certain query. The genre import requires user confirmation and can be overriden
by selecting a different alternative or by specifying a [rateyourmusic.com][rym]
URL.

## Thanks

Thanks to [Rui Gon√ßalves][ruippeixotog], who created the original `genres-tree`
yaml, using his [scala-scraper][scala-scraper] library.
